## Exploring Country Expenditures: Unveiling Insights from Preprocessed Data

I came across an intriguing dataset on Kaggle during my exploration, focusing on country expenditures. The dataset appeared well-preprocessed by ADAM_GREY, requiring minimal cleaning. I proceeded to utilize it in its original form, with the addition of a region column for potential analysis. Interestingly, despite this addition, I didn't incorporate the region variable into the final dashboard. My goal was to uncover patterns and meaningful insights within the various expenditures of countries.

Primarily, I conducted pivot table analyses to summarize and organize the data effectively. Additionally, I generated tables necessary for constructing diagrams that would visually represent the insights derived from the dataset. These steps were crucial in facilitating the visualization of expenditure patterns and identifying significant trends across countries.
