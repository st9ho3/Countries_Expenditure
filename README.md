## Exploring Country Expenditures: Unveiling Insights from Preprocessed Data

I came across an intriguing dataset on Kaggle during my exploration, focusing on country expenditures. The dataset appeared well-preprocessed by ADAM_GREY, requiring minimal cleaning. I proceeded to utilize it in its original form, with the addition of a region column for potential analysis. Interestingly, despite this addition, I didn't incorporate the region variable into the final dashboard. My goal was to uncover patterns and meaningful insights within the various expenditures of countries.

Primarily, I conducted pivot table analyses to summarize and organize the data effectively. Additionally, I generated tables necessary for constructing diagrams that would visually represent the insights derived from the dataset. These steps were crucial in facilitating the visualization of expenditure patterns and identifying significant trends across countries.

## Understanding Country Expenditures: Trends, Dynamics, and Sector Analysis Dashboard
At the bottom of the dashboard, there is a column graph illustrating the expenditure trends of each country over the past 21 years. Additionally, a line overlay depicts the fluctuation of these expenditures relative to the country's GDP, offering insights into their changing dynamics over time.

Furthermore, the dashboard includes two slicers enabling users to filter expenditures by country and sector. This functionality allows for a deeper analysis of each sector's expenditure trends over time, providing a comprehensive understanding of how they evolve within and across countries.


Feel free to download the main .xlsm file and experiment with the slicers to explore the data further. You can also check the expenditures related to your country using the interactive features available.
